# @flaredlink/cli

Create, edit, and measure [Flared](https://flared.page) short links from your terminal. The installed command is `flared`. It needs Node.js 20 or later.

```sh
npm install -g @flaredlink/cli
flared login
flared link create https://example.com/launch --slug launch
flared analytics launch
```

Create an API token in the Flared app under Settings. `flared login` asks for it without showing it, checks it with the API, and saves it in `~/.config/flared/config.json` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/flared`; `%APPDATA%\flared` on Windows), readable only by you. In CI, set `FLARED_TOKEN` instead, or pipe the token to `flared login --token-stdin`.

| `flared logout`                                                                           | Delete the saved token. Revoke it in Settings to stop it working.   |
| `flared whoami`                                                                           | Show the token, its scopes, and the API URL.                        |
| `flared link create URL [--slug S] [--title T] [--domain HOSTNAME] [--idempotency-key K]` | Create a link and print its short URL. Reuse a key to retry safely. |
| `flared link list [--search Q] [--limit N] [--cursor C] [--all]`                          | List links, newest first.                                           |
| `flared link get LINK`                                                                    | Show one link.                                                      |

`LINK` is a link ID or a slug. `DOMAIN` is a domain hostname or ID. Every command accepts `--json` for machine-readable output and `--api-url URL`.

## Custom domains

Use a subdomain you own, such as `go.example.com`, for your short links:

```sh
flared domain add go.example.com
# Create the CNAME record it prints, then:
flared domain check go.example.com
flared link create https://example.com/launch --domain go.example.com
```

`domain add`, `check`, and `remove` need a token with the `domains:write` scope; `domain list` and `--domain` need `domains:read`. A domain serves links once its status is `active`. Without `--domain`, a link uses the default domain. `flared domain remove` tells you how many active links stop and needs `--yes` to go ahead. The links and their slugs stay reserved, so adding the domain again restores them.

`flared link qr` encodes the short URL: SVG by default, or a 512 × 512 PNG with `--format png --out FILE`.

## Self-hosted Flared

Point the CLI at your instance's API with `--api-url` or `FLARED_API_URL`, for example `https://links.example.com/v1`. `flared login --api-url URL` saves it with the token. HTTPS is required except on `localhost`.

With `--json`, errors go to standard error as `{ "error": { "code", "message", "requestId" } }`.
